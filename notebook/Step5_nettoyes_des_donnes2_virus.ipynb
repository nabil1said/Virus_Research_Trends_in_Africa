The antigenic detection of rotaviruses carried out        by ELISA test was followed by the antigenic (VP6 sub-groups) and molecular        characterization: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and genetic typing. The        general prevalence of Rotavirus diarrhoea was 27.9%. Among the children who were        found positive, those whose age ranged from 0 to 11 months old accounted for        45.8% against 41.3% and 12.9% for those whose age ranged from 1 to 2 and 3 to 5        years old respectively proving thus the precocity of rotavirus infection.

PG - 5 BACKGROUND: Though the major target of the HIV-virus is the immune system, the frequency of abdominal disorders in HIV/AIDS patients has been reported to be second only to pulmonary disease. These abdominal manifestations may be on the increase as the use of antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy and improved quality of life. Ultrasonography is an easy to perform, non invasive, inexpensive and safe imaging technique that is invaluable in Africa where AIDS is most prevalent and where sophisticated diagnostic tools are not readily available. PURPOSE: To describe the findings and evaluate the clinical utility of abdominal ultrasonography in HIV/AIDS patients in Ibadan, Nigeria METHODS: A Prospective evaluation of the abdominal ultrasonography of 391 HIV-positive patients as well as 391 age and sex-matched HIV-negative patients were carried out at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. RESULTS: Of the 391 cases studied, 260 (66.5%) were females; the mean age was 38.02 years, (range 15-66 years). The disease was most prevalent in the 4th decade with an incidence of 40.4%. Compared with the HIV-negative individuals, the HIV+ group of patients had a significantly higher proportion of splenomegaly (13.5% vs. 7.7%; p < 0.01), lymphadenopathy (2.0% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.70), and renal abnormalities (8.4% vs. 3.8%; p < 0.02). There were no differences in hepatic and pancreatic abnormalities between the HIV+ and HIV- groups. There were significantly fewer gallstones in the HIV+ group (1.4% vs. 5.1%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: AIDS is a multi-systemic disease and its demographic and clinical pattern remains the same globally. Ultrasonography is optimally suited for its clinical management especially in Africa. Its accuracy and sensitivity may be much improved with clinico-pathologic correlation which may not be readily available in developing countries; further studies may provide this much needed diagnostic algorithms.\",\n          \"Etiologic agents of central nervous system infections among febrile hospitalized patients in the country of Georgia. PG - e111393 OBJECTIVES: There is a large spectrum of viral, bacterial, fungal, and prion pathogens that cause central nervous system (CNS) infections. As such, identification of the etiological agent requires multiple laboratory tests and accurate diagnosis requires clinical and epidemiological information. This hospital-based study aimed to determine the main causes of acute meningitis and encephalitis and enhance laboratory capacity for CNS infection diagnosis. METHODS: Children and adults patients clinically diagnosed with meningitis or encephalitis were enrolled at four reference health centers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected for bacterial culture, and in-house and multiplex RT-PCR testing was conducted for herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, mumps virus, enterovirus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Streptococcus pneumoniae, HiB and Neisseria meningitidis. RESULTS: Out of 140 enrolled patients, the mean age was 23.9 years, and 58% were children. Bacterial or viral etiologies were determined in 51% of patients. Five Streptococcus pneumoniae cultures were isolated from CSF. Based on in-house PCR analysis, 25 patients were positive for S. pneumoniae, 6 for N. meningitidis, and 1 for H. influenzae. Viral multiplex PCR identified infections with enterovirus (n = 26), VZV (n = 4), and HSV-1 (n = 2). No patient was positive for mumps or HSV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate that S. pneumoniae and enteroviruses are the main etiologies in this patient cohort. The utility of molecular diagnostics for pathogen identification combined with the knowledge provided by the investigation may improve health outcomes of CNS infection cases in Georgia.\",\n          \"Whole-genome characterization of G12 rotavirus strains detected in Mozambique reveals a co-infection with a GXP[14] strain of possible animal origin. PG - 932-937 A high prevalence of G12 rotavirus strains has previously been reported in southern Mozambique. In this study, the full genomes of five Mozambican G12 strains were determined directly from stool using an Illumina Miseq platform. One sample (0060) contained an intergenogroup co-infection of a G12P[8] Wa-like strain and a GXP[14] DS-1-like strain. The sequences of seven genome segments, detected for the GXP[14] strain, clustered with a diverse group of mostly animal strains, suggesting co-infection with a strain of possible animal origin. The stool samples contained G12P[6] rotavirus strains with Wa-like backbones. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP4 and VP7 encoding segments of the G12P[6] strains suggested that they were reassortants containing backbones that are similar to that of the G12P[8] strain. The study confirms previous observations of interspecies transmission and emphasizes the importance of whole-genome sequencing in order to evaluate rotavirus co-infections and reassortants.\"\n

METHODS: In 327 randomly selected households,        1684 individuals were enrolled and followed-up for 6 to 10 months during 2016        through 2018 from 2 communities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice weekly        and tested for pneumococcus using quantitative lytA real-time polymerase chain        reaction. A Markov model was fitted to the data to define the start and end of an        episode of colonization. We assessed factors associated with colonization using        logistic regression. RESULTS: During the study period, 98% (1655/1684) of        participants were colonized with pneumococcus at least once. Younger age (<5        years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 14.1; 95% confidence [CI], 1.8-111.3, and 5-24        years: aOR, 4.8, 95% CI, 1.9-11.9, compared with 25-44 years) and HIV infection        (aOR, 10.1; 95% CI, 1.3-77.1) were associated with increased odds of        colonization. Children aged <5 years had fewer colonization episodes (median, 9)        than individuals \\u22655 years (median, 18; P < .001) but had a longer episode        duration (<5 years: 35.5 days; interquartile range, 17-88) vs. \\u22655 years: 5.5 days        (4-12). High pneumococcal loads were associated with age (<1 year: aOR 25.4; 95%        CI, 7.4-87.6; 1-4 years: aOR 13.5, 95% CI 8.3-22.9; 5-14 years: aOR 3.1, 95% CI,        2.1-4.4 vs. 45-65 year old patients) and HIV infection (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.4).        CONCLUSIONS: We observed high levels of pneumococcus colonization across all age        groups. Children and people with HIV were more likely to be colonized and had        higher pneumococcal loads. Carriage duration decreased with age highlighting that        children remain important in pneumococcal transmission. CI  - \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The main objective of this study is to enhance the accuracy of        BT risk prediction by relying on machine learning (ML) approaches to help in        fulfilling this inquiry. Several risk factors of BT that affect the occurrence        and magnitude of animal infection with the virus have been reported globally.        Additionally, risk factors, such as sex, age, species, and season, unevenly        affect animal health and welfare. Therefore, the seroprevalence study data of 233        apparently healthy animals (125 sheep and 108 goats) from five different        provinces in Egypt were used to analyze and compare the performance of the        algorithms in predicting BT risk. RESULTS: Logistic regression (LR), decision        tree (DT), random forest (RF), and a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN)        were used to develop predictive BT risk models and compare their performance to        the base model (LR). Model performance was assessed by the area under the        receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, true positive rate        (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), precision, and F1        score. The results indicated that RF performed better than other models, with an        AUC score of 81%, ANN of 79.6%, and DT of 72.85%. In terms of performance and        prediction, LR showed a much lower value (AUC\\u2009=\\u200969%). Upon further observation of        the results, it was discovered that age and season were the most important        predictor variables reported in classification and prediction. CONCLUSION: The        findings of this study can be utilized to predict and control BT risk factors in        sheep and goats, with better diagnostic discrimination in terms of accuracy, TPR,        FNR, FPR, and precision of ML models over traditional and commonly used LR        models. Our findings advocate that the implementation of ML algorithms, mainly        RF, in farm decision making and prediction is a promising technique for analyzing        cross-section studies, providing adequate predictive power and significant        competence in identifying and ranking predictors representing potential risk        factors for BT.

Some viruses have neuroinvasive properties and activate the immune response in        the brain. These immune events may be neuroprotective or they may cause long-term        damage similar to what is seen in some neurodegenerative diseases. The new        \\\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\\\" (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the        Respiratory viruses causing highly acute lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease        2019 (COVID-19) with clinical similarities to those reported in \\\"Severe Acute        Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\"(SARS-CoV) and the \\\"Middle East Respiratory        Syndrome Coronavirus\\\"(MERS-CoV) including neurological manifestation. To examine        the possible neurological damage induced by SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to        understand the immune reactions to viral infection in the brain, and their short-        and long-term consequences. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and        SARS-CoV-2, which will be discussed, cooperative homological and phylogenetical        studies lead us to question if SARS-CoV-2 can have similar neuroinvasive        capacities and neuroinflammatiory events that may lead to the same short- and        long-term neuropathologies that SARS-CoV had shown in human and animal models. To        explain the neurological manifestation caused by SARS-CoV-2, we will present a        literature review of 765 COVID-19 patients, in which 18% had neurological        symptoms and complications, including encephalopathy, encephalitis and        cerebrovascular pathologies, acute myelitis, and Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome.

PG - 960-975 In December 2019, an outbreak of pandemic severe respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially occurred in China, has spread the world resulted in serious threats to human public health. Uncommon neurological manifestations with pathophysiological symptoms were observed in infected patients including headache, seizures, and neuroimmunological disorders. Regardless of whether these neurological symptoms are direct or indirect casual infection relationship, this novel viral infection has a relevant impact on the neuroimmune system that requires a neurologist's careful assessment. Recently, the use of immunotherapy has been emerged in fighting against COVID-19 infection despite the uncertain efficiency in managing COVID-19 related disorders or even its proven failure by increasing its severity. Herein, the author is addressing the first approaches in using immunotherapies in controlling COVID-19 viral impact on the brain by highlighting their role in decreasing or increasing infection risks among subjects. This point of view review article supports the use of immunotherapies in managing COVID-19 neurological disorders but in optimal timing and duration to ensure the maximum therapeutic outcome by reducing morbidity and mortality rate. Based on recently published data, the current review article highlights the beneficial effects and drawbacks of using immunotherapies to combat COVID-19 and its neurological symptoms.\",\n          \"MiDRMpol: A High-Throughput Multiplexed Amplicon Sequencing Workflow to Quantify HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations against Protease, Reverse Transcriptase, and Integrase Inhibitors. The detection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in minor viral populations is of potential clinical importance. However, sophisticated computational infrastructure and competence for analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data lack at most diagnostic laboratories. Thus, we have proposed a new pipeline, MiDRMpol, to quantify DRM from the HIV-1 pol region. The gag-vpu region of 87 plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals from three cohorts was amplified and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2500. The sequence reads were adapter-trimmed, followed by analysis using in-house scripts. Samples from Swedish and Ethiopian cohorts were also sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The pipeline was validated against the online tool PASeq (Polymorphism Analysis by Sequencing). Based on an error rate of <1%, a value of >1% was set as reliable to consider a minor variant. Both pipelines detected the mutations in the dominant viral populations, while discrepancies were observed in minor viral populations. In five HIV-1 subtype C samples, minor mutations were detected at the <5% level by MiDRMpol but not by PASeq. MiDRMpol is a computationally as well as labor efficient bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of DRM from HTS data. It identifies minor viral populations (<20%) of DRMs. Our method can be incorporated into large-scale surveillance of HIV-1 DRM.\",\n          \"Perinatal transmission of hepatitis C antigens: envelope 1, envelope 2 and non-structural 4. PG - 568-74 BACKGROUND: Perinatal exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens during pregnancy may affect the developing immune system in the fetus. We aimed to study the perinatal transmission of HCV structural and non-structural antigens. METHODS: Sera from 402 pregnant mothers were tested for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA. HCV antigens were determined in sera from 101 HCV-infected mothers and their cord blood. RESULTS: In both serum and cord blood samples, HCV NS4 (non-structural 4) at 27 kDa, E1 (envelope 1) at 38 kDa and E2 (envelope 2) at 40 kDa were identified, purified and quantified using western blotting, electroelution and ELISA. Maternal sera and neonate cord blood samples had similar detection rates for NS4 (94.1%), E1 (90.1%) and E2 (90.1%). The mean maternal serum levels (optical density, OD) of HCV NS4 (0.87 \\u00b1 0.01), E1 (0.86 \\u00b1 0.01) and E2 (0.85 \\u00b1 0.01) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from those of neonatal cord blood (0.83 \\u00b1 0.01, 0.87 \\u00b1 0.01 and 0.85 \\u00b1 0.01, respectively). Also, strong correlations (p < 0.0001) were shown between sera and cord blood sample levels of HCV NS4, r = 0.77; E1, r = 0.76 and E2, r = 0.80. The vertical transmission of these antigens in vaginal delivery did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from those in caesarean section. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that vertical transmission of HCV NS4, E1 and E2 antigens was very high. Thus, exposure to these antigens may influence the developing immune responses to natural infection or future vaccination.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
